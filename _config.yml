  <p>I am an experienced Data Analyst with more than four years of practice under my belt. I am currently enrolled in the Springboard Data Science Bootcamp to expand my knowledge and experience in data science and machine learning. My passion lies in leveraging data to tackle real-world problems, and I am always excited for the opportunity to discuss interesting topics and collaborate with others. When I am not crunching numbers, I can be found exploring different places, spending quality time with my family, or enjoying a cup of coffee. My motto, “never cease to learn, for life is an endless teacher”, is something I live by and always strive to abide by.</p>
