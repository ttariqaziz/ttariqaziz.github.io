  <p>I am a Data Analyst with more than four years of experience, actively pursuing further knowledge and experience in data science and machine learning through the Springboard Data Science Bootcamp. I am passionate about leveraging data to solve real-world problems, and am always keen to have interesting conversations and collaborate with others. When I'm not crunching numbers, I can be found enjoying a cup of coffee, or living by my motto: never cease to learn, for life is an endless teacher.</p>
