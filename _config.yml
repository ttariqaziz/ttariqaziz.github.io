  <p>I am a highly skilled Data Scientist with over four years of experience in the field. Currently, I am working at DataKind and serving as a Data Science Fellow at Springboard. I have a strong passion for using data to solve real-world problems, and I am always eager to engage in stimulating discussions and collaborate with others. Exploring new places, spending quality time with my loved ones, and enjoying a cup of coffee are some of the things that bring me joy in my free time. I firmly believe in the philosophy of "never stop learning," and I strive to live by this motto every day. I am confident in my analytical skills and expertise and am currently seeking challenging Data Scientist opportunities to drive business success.</p>
